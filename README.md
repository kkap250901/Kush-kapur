# My Degree 🎓 - 1st till now (76/100):

I am currently studying Physics and Computer Science at Durham University under the Natural Sciences Program and graduate in 2024.

## Third Year 🥉 - 1st (76/100):
  
* N-Body Solver - [N-Body-solver](https://github.com/kkap250901/N-Body-Solver): 85/100. [C++]
    >
    > We were tasked with solving the N-Body problem. To do this I Implemented Linked Cell algorithm and Euler's method for gravitational and molecular forces. Optimized code with vectorization and parallelization using OpenMP pragma, measured scalability with strong scaling. This was visualised using paraview.

* Recommender Systems - [BST-Recommender-System](https://github.com/kkap250901/Movie-Reccomender-System): 81/100. [Pytorch]
    > ![Gifdemo](https://github.com/kkap250901/Movie-Reccomender-System/blob/main/user-video-gif.gif)
    >
    > I implemented two state-of-the-art deep model-based recommender systems (RS), a novel content-collaborative hybrid RS using the Transformer architecture and a solely collaborative RS. These RSs foster user satisfaction in different ways; the first by capturing the complex user-item interaction structures and the second that exploits temporal data. To compliment these RSs I created a fully-fledged UI where user can log in, register, submit new reviews and retrieve personalized movie recommendations using our two recommender systems. Due to being highly optimized, the recommender can retrain itself almost instantly when a user submits a new review or on alteration to a prediction which allows the user to interact with the recommender and see the recommendations change in real-time.


* Deep Learning - [VQGAN](https://github.com/kkap250901/Image-generative-models-VQGAN): 93/100. [PyTorch]
    > ![Gifdemo](https://github.com/kkap250901/Image-generative-models-VQGAN/blob/main/Images/General-results.png)
    > 
    >  The task was to generate realisitic and diverse images (using the FFHQ dataset) given severe hardware constraints and then to interpolate smoothly between these images. To do this, This paper proposes a VQVAE[8] architecture in combination with a transformer trained on the FFHQ dataset. This model utilizes convolutions to learn a context rich vocabulary capturing the local interactions of the image pixels, and uses a transformer architecture to learn complex long term relationships between these visual features to synthesise high resolution images.

    > ![inter_2](https://github.com/kkap250901/Image-generative-models-VQGAN/blob/main/Images/best-results.png)


* Reinforcement Learning - [TQC](https://github.com/kkap250901/Reinforcement-learning-bipedal-walker): 93/100. [PyTorch]
    > Easy Environment Performance
    >
    >![Gifdemo](https://github.com/kkap250901/Reinforcement-learning-bipedal-walker/blob/main/Results/ccbd24-agent-video%2Cepisode%3D1501%2Cscore%3D334.gif)
    >
    > Hard Environment Performance

    >![Gifdemo_2](https://github.com/kkap250901/Reinforcement-learning-bipedal-walker/blob/main/Results/ccbd24-agent-hardcore-video%2Cepisode%3D2526%2Cscore%3D312.gif)

    > We were tasked with creating a Reinforcement Learning agent to complete the Bipedal Walker gym hard and easy environments. To do this, this paper explores the possible algorithms which could be used to solve the BipedalWalker-v3 environments. From our study, it is found that Truncated Quantile Critic is successful at solving the easy environment with consistent mean rewards greater than 300 over the last 100 episodes. Although, we find that despite trying different parameters, we are not able to solve the Bipedal Hardcore environment according to Open AI’s definition. However, we are able to consistently get mean rewards greater than 270 over the span of 100 episodes.

* Internship Reasearch Project - [sentiment-macro-stock-prediction](https://github.com/kkap250901/Stock-Prediction). [Pytorch]
    > 
    > During my internship at Amtex where I was working with Lazard Asset Management quant division I created a forecast model which scrapes data from Financial Times, Reddit, Twitter and gets macro economic data at a daily level. We use FinBERT(a pre trained hugging face NLP model) for sentiment analysis. Using all these features and a transformer model we make a prediciton for the next day price of the equity. We make this very general such that you only need to define the Equity's name.

* Computational Modelling in the Humanities and Social Sciences - [US-president-speeches](https://github.com/kkap250901/Analysing-US-president-speeches): 75/100. 
    > Democrat vs Republican presidential topics during the globalisation years 
    > ![inter_1](https://github.com/kkap250901/Analysing-US-president-speeches/blob/main/Figures/Democrat-topics.png)
    > ![inter_2](https://github.com/kkap250901/Analysing-US-president-speeches/blob/main/Figures/Republican-topics.png)
    >
    > Polarity vs subjectivity of recent presidents 
    > ![inter_3](https://github.com/kkap250901/Analysing-US-president-speeches/blob/main/Figures/Polarity-of-presidents.png)
    >
    > I Designed pipeline for historical presidential speech analysis. Scraped speeches, political affiliations, and used NLP techniques, including LDA, NMF, and Word2Vec, for text analysis. Conducted sentiment analysis using Vader, TextBlob, and pre-trained BERT models. With this we are able to filter speeches and observe how the topics discussed between the democrats presidents vs republican presidents have changed overtime. 

* AI search - [TSP-problem](https://github.com/kkap250901/Travelling-Sales-Person-Problem): 81/100. 
    > 
    > We were tasked with solving the Travelling sales person problem for a given distance matrices between a number of cities. To solve this I used nature inspired heuristic algorithms : Ant Colony Optimisation and Genetic Algorithms. These gave optimal tours for up to 256 cities, but after doing research and novel improvements by combining ACO and GA, I got optimal tours for up to 530 citites in a more efficient and better algorithms.

* Image Processing - [Image-processing](https://github.com/kkap250901/Image-Processing): 75/100
    > Output video 
    >![Gifdemo](https://github.com/kkap250901/Image-Processing/blob/main/output_video.gif)
    > This Project uses several Image Processing Algorithms to output a final video. The aim of this study is to create a video from the processed images, which when processed through the Yolo.py and compare images.py algorithm gives us highest possible Yolo and SSIM scores.
